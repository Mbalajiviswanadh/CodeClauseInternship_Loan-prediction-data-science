## Description

Company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer detail provided while filling online application form.

To automate this process, they have given a problem to identify the customers segments, those are eligible for loan amount so that they can specifically target these customers. Here they have provided a partial data set.



**This Repository contains the Loan Prediction Project created by using 4 different Machine Learning Algorithms.**

**Classification Algorithms used:**
1. Logistic Regression (LR)
2. Super Vector Machine (SVM)
3. Decision Tree 
4. K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
